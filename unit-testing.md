# Unit Testing Documentation

[TOC]

## Introduction

Unit testing is an essential practice in software development that involves testing individual units or components of
code to ensure their correctness. In this documentation, we will explore the fundamentals of unit testing, its benefits,
and how to write effective unit tests for PHP and Magento 2.

## Benefits of Unit Testing

Unit testing offers numerous benefits, including:

1. **Bug Prevention**: By testing individual units of code, potential bugs and errors can be identified and fixed early
   in the development process, reducing the overall cost and effort required.

2. **Code Maintainability**: Unit tests act as a safety net when making changes to the codebase. They provide assurance
   that existing functionality will not break due to modifications, making it easier to refactor and improve code.

3. **Documentation**: Unit tests serve as living documentation, providing examples of how the code should be used and
   the expected behavior of its components.

4. **Rapid Feedback**: Unit tests enable quick feedback on code changes, as they can be executed independently and do
   not require the entire application to be running.

5. **Collaboration**: Unit tests facilitate collaboration among developers by providing a common understanding of code
   functionality and behavior.

## Unit Testing in PHP

### PHPUnit

PHPUnit is a widely used unit testing framework for PHP. It provides a rich set of assertions, test runners, and other
utilities to aid in writing effective unit tests. Let's look at some examples of how to write unit tests using PHPUnit.

To begin, create a new test class, `MyClassTest`, that extends the `PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase` class:

```php
use PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase;

class MyClassTest extends TestCase
{
    // Test methods will be written here
}
```

#### Asserting Equality

PHPUnit provides various assertion methods to validate expected outcomes. One common assertion is to check for equality
between expected and actual values. For example:

```php
public function testAddition()
{
    $result = 2 + 2;
    $this->assertEquals(4, $result);
}
```

In the above example, the `assertEquals` method checks whether the `$result` variable is equal to `4`.

#### Mocking Dependencies

When testing code that has dependencies, it's often necessary to create mocks or stubs to isolate the unit being tested.
PHPUnit provides a `getMock()` method to create mock objects.

```php
public function testSomethingWithMock()
{
    $dependencyMock = $this->getMockBuilder(DependencyClass::class)
                          ->getMock();

    // Use the mock object within the test
}
```

In the above example, the `getMockBuilder()` method creates a mock object of the `DependencyClass`. This allows the test
to control the behavior of the dependency and focus solely on the unit being tested.

For more advanced mocking scenarios, PHPUnit also supports the use of mock libraries such as Mockery and Prophecy.

## Unit Testing in Magento 2

### Magento Testing Framework (MTF)

Magento 2 provides a dedicated testing framework called Magento Testing Framework (MTF) for writing unit tests. MTF
extends PHPUnit and introduces additional features specific to Magento.

To write unit tests in Magento 2, follow these steps:

1. Create a new test class that extends the `Magento\FunctionalTestingFramework\TestCase\TestCase` class:

```php
use Magento\FunctionalTestingFramework\TestCase\TestCase;

class MyMagentoTest extends TestCase
{
    // Test methods will be written here
}
```

2. Use the Magento testing APIs to interact with the Magento system and test the desired functionality.

```php
public function testMyCustomModule()
{
    $this->loginAdminUser('admin', 'password');
    $this->openAdminPage('my_custom_module');
    $this->seePageTitle('My Custom Module');
    // Additional assertions and interactions
}
```

In the above example, the test interacts with the Magento system by logging in as an admin user, opening an admin page,
and asserting the expected page title.

### Data Fixtures

Magento 2 allows the creation of data fixtures to provide consistent test data for unit tests. Data fixtures are defined
in XML files and can be used to set up test scenarios.

```xml

<testData>
    <fixture>
        <name>my_module_data</name>
        <data>
            <table_name>
                <row>
                    <column1>value1</column1>
                    <column2>value2</column2>
                </row>
            </table_name>
        </data>
    </fixture>
</testData>
```

In the above example, a fixture named `my_module_data` is defined, which inserts a row into the `table_name` table with
specified column values.

Fixtures can be used within a test using the `loadFixture()` method provided by MTF:

```php
public function testMyModuleWithFixture()
{
    $this->loadFixture('my_module_data');
    // Additional test logic using the fixture data
}
```

## Conclusion

Unit testing plays a crucial role in software development, enabling developers to validate the correctness of individual
units of code. By incorporating unit testing into your PHP and Magento 2 projects, you can increase code quality, reduce
bugs, and improve maintainability. Use this documentation as a guide to get started with unit testing and leverage the
benefits it offers. Happy testing!
