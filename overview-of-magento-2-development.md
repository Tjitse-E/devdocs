Magento 2 development encompasses a broad range of activities, from theme and extension development to performance
optimization and customization of the core functionality. Magento 2 offers flexibility, extensibility, and a rich set of
out-of-the-box features that can be leveraged to develop a wide range of eCommerce solutions.

## Development Principles

Magento 2 adheres to the principles of modularity, scalability, and extensibility. It leverages an architecture that
encourages reuse, loose coupling, and configuration over coding.

## Environment Setup

Setting up a proper Magento 2 development environment is crucial. This typically includes a local development server (
like XAMPP, WAMP, or MAMP), a PHP IDE or editor, and command-line tools like Composer and Git.

## Theme Development

Magento 2 theme development involves creating a visual design for your eCommerce store. You can create a new theme from
scratch, or extend and customize an existing theme.

## Extension Development

Extensions or modules in Magento 2 allow you to add new functionality or modify existing functionality. Magento 2 has a
modular architecture, allowing developers to customize and extend the platform without altering the core codebase.

## Customization Techniques

Magento 2 provides various customization techniques including plugins (Interceptors), observers/events, and rewrites. It
encourages developers to follow the 'do not modify core' principle.

## Testing

Testing is an integral part of Magento 2 development. Magento 2 provides a testing framework that supports various types
of tests, including unit tests, integration tests, functional tests, and more.

## Performance Optimization

Magento 2 offers a range of performance optimization options, such as Full Page Cache (FPC), Varnish, Redis, and
performance toolkit for benchmarking your site's performance.
