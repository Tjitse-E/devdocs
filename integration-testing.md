# Integration Testing Documentation

[TOC]

## Introduction

Integration testing is a crucial part of the software development process, particularly in complex systems like Magento
2. It verifies that different components of an application work together as expected when integrated. This documentation
provides an overview of integration testing in Magento 2, including its importance, common techniques, and best
practices.

## Why Integration Testing?

Integration testing ensures that individual components, such as modules, classes, or services, can seamlessly interact
with each other without causing unexpected issues. It identifies integration problems early in the development cycle,
preventing them from becoming more difficult and expensive to fix later on.

## Integration Testing Techniques

Magento 2 provides several techniques to perform integration testing:

### Unit Tests

Unit tests are the foundation of integration testing. They focus on testing individual units of code, such as functions
or methods, in isolation. These tests ensure that each unit behaves as expected when integrated with other units. Unit
testing frameworks like PHPUnit are commonly used in Magento 2 to write unit tests.

Example unit test using PHPUnit:

```php
class ExampleTest extends \PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
{
    public function testAddition()
    {
        $calculator = new Calculator();
        $result = $calculator->add(2, 3);
        
        $this->assertEquals(5, $result);
    }
}
```

### Integration Tests

Integration tests go beyond unit tests by verifying the interaction of multiple units together. They ensure that
components integrate correctly and work together as intended. Integration tests often cover scenarios where units
communicate with databases, external services, or other modules.

Example integration test using Magento 2's testing framework:

```php
class ExampleIntegrationTest extends \Magento\TestFramework\TestCase\AbstractController
{
    public function testCustomerLogin()
    {
        $this->dispatch('customer/account/login');
        $this->assertRedirectTo('customer/account/index');
    }
}
```

### API Testing

API testing focuses on testing the integration of an application's APIs. It ensures that APIs behave correctly, handle
requests and responses properly, and maintain data integrity.

Example API test using PHPUnit and Guzzle:

```php
class ExampleApiTest extends \PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
{
    public function testGetUser()
    {
        $client = new \GuzzleHttp\Client();

        $response = $client->get('https://api.example.com/users/1');
        $data = json_decode($response->getBody(), true);

        $this->assertEquals('John Doe', $data['name']);
    }
}
```

## Best Practices for Integration Testing in Magento 2

### Use Test Fixtures

Test fixtures are pre-defined data sets that provide a known starting point for integration tests. They ensure
consistent and predictable test environments. In Magento 2, fixtures can be created using
the `Magento\TestFramework\Helper\Bootstrap` class or by extending
the `Magento\TestFramework\TestCase\AbstractController` class.

Example fixture creation in Magento 2:

```php
class ExampleIntegrationTest extends \Magento\TestFramework\TestCase\AbstractController
{
    protected function setUp(): void
    {
        $this->setUpBeforeClass();
        $this->loadFixture('example_fixture');
    }
}
```

### Isolate External Dependencies

When performing integration tests, it's crucial to isolate external dependencies, such as databases, third-party APIs,
or services. This helps maintain test reliability and prevents issues caused by external factors. Techniques like
mocking and stubbing are commonly used to isolate dependencies.

Example dependency isolation using PHPUnit:

```php
class ExampleIntegrationTest extends \PHPUnit\Framework\TestCase
{
    public function testOrderTotalCalculation()
    {
        $order = $this->getMockBuilder(Order::class)
            ->disableOriginalConstructor()
            ->getMock();

        $order->method('getTotal')->willReturn(100);

        $calculator = new OrderTotalCalculator();
        $result = $calculator->calculate($order);

        $this->assertEquals(105, $result);
    }
}
```

### Keep Tests Isolated and Independent

Each integration test should be independent of others and should not rely on shared state or previous test outcomes.
Isolating tests ensures that failures are easier to diagnose and reproduce. Magento 2's testing framework provides tools
for database rollbacks and fixtures to help maintain test independence.

### Run Tests Regularly

To ensure the ongoing stability and reliability of your Magento 2 application, it's essential to run integration tests
regularly, ideally as part of a continuous integration (CI) or continuous delivery (CD) pipeline. Running tests
frequently helps catch integration issues early and enables developers to address them promptly.

## Conclusion

Integration testing is a critical aspect of software development, including Magento 2 projects. By performing
integration testing, you can detect and resolve issues in the interactions between different components, ensuring the
overall quality and stability of your application. Following the best practices outlined in this documentation will help
you write effective and reliable integration tests for your Magento 2 projects.
